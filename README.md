Building an E-commerce Recommendation System with Machine Learning and Flask

This project outlines how to build a personalized e-commerce recommendation system using Python, Flask, and various machine learning techniques. The goal is to enhance the user experience on an e-commerce platform by providing tailored product suggestions, thereby increasing user engagement and sales.

Features
Personalized Recommendations: Delivers product suggestions based on individual user preferences and behavior.

Multiple Recommendation Models: Implements and combines different recommendation approaches:

Content-based Filtering: Recommends items with similar attributes.

Collaborative Filtering: Uses user-item interaction data to find patterns and make predictions.

Hybrid & Multi-model Approaches: Combines the above methods for more accurate and diverse results.

Flask Web Application: Provides a user-friendly web interface for browsing products, viewing recommendations, and interacting with the system.

Scalable Architecture: Built with Python libraries like pandas, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow for efficient data processing and model training.

Technologies Used
Flask: The web framework for the e-commerce application.

Python: The core programming language.

Machine Learning Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow.

Getting Started
Clone the repository:

git clone [repository-url]
cd [repository-name]
Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Flask application:

python app.py
How It Works
The system is built on a simple workflow:

Data: E-commerce data (product details, user ratings, interactions) is collected and preprocessed.

Models: The data is used to train different machine learning models.

Integration: The trained models are integrated into a Flask application, which serves recommendations to users on the website.
